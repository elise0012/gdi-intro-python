## LUNCH / MEALS

We try to find companies to sponsor a meal during our classes if they
are over 4 hours long. If we are able to find a sponsor, the meals are
usually something affordable for feeding a large group, like pizza. In
these instances, we will offer both vegetarian and meat based
options. If you have other dietary restrictions such as gluten free,
dairy free, vegan, etc., please be sure to bring your own lunch. We
will notify attendees a day or two before the class on whether a meal
will be provided.
